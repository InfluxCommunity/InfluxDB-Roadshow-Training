    "description": "In this two-hour hands-on virtual training session, you will learn how to build an IoT application using InfluxDB and Telegraf while collecting data from edge devices using an MQTT broker. We will start by showing you how to set up an instance of InfluxDB and Telegraf on an edge device to ingest sensor data via an MQTT Broker. Then, to highlight our new edge replication feature, you will move on to downsampling the data to send on to an InfluxDB Cloud instance. Next, you will build notebooks that you can share with others as well as some checks and alerts and some interesting visualizations that show the power of geolocation and time series data.",
